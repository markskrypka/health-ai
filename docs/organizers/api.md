# API Documentation

The full API reference is generated from the service itself, so it is always
the version you are actually calling.

**[Open the API reference (ReDoc)](/api/redoc)**

That is the whole public surface: the clinic you read patient records and
availability from, and the routes your agent posts its actions to before the
call ends. Every request and response body is documented there with its fields
and types.

If you would rather try a request live than read about it, the same schema is
served as Swagger UI at **[/api/docs](/api/docs)**, and as raw OpenAPI at
`/api/openapi.json`.

Both live on the API host the desk gave you, and both need your team's API key
in the `X-Api-Key` header.
